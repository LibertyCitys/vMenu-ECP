# Project Fairness vMenu
The vMenu for Project Fairness and other affiliated server, with PFSync. All actions are subject to change.

# vMenu
vMenu is server sided menu for FiveM servers, including full\* permission support.


\*(Some features do not have permissions support as they are either harmless or it'd just be silly to deny them. However, they will be disabled if you deny access to the submenu that they are a part of (eg: unlimited stamina in Player Options will be disabled if you deny `vMenu.PlayerOptions.Menu`.))

The intention of this vMenu is to create the ultimate vMenu from Vespura's resources, while also achieving the same features seen on other servers such as Rockstar Mischief and Impulse99, which have a modified vMenu, while adding and integrating new features inside of said vMenu.

# Download & Installation & Permissions

## Download
Download Vespura's vMenu [here](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/releases) for the original version.

--------

## Compiling of the Project Fairness vMenu
Compiling the vMenu is quite easy and straight-forward, if you have Visual Studio. By grabbing the NuGet packages for CitizenFX.Core.Client and CitizenFX.Core.Server as well as the NuGet package for MenuAPI, all you have to do is compile and that's it. All support of the Projectr Fairness vMenu will never be receiving troubleshoot support by Vespura, so do not bother asking for support to him. This is a fork of his project. Please pull a Issue request if you have any problems with this vMenu.

## Installation
Please follow the instructions over at the [vMenu docs](https://docs.vespura.com/vmenu/installation)

## Support
If you like Vespura's work, please consider supporting him on [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/vespura). He's put a _lot_ of my time and hard work into his vMenu and other projects.

--------

## Pull Requests
We are glad at accepting Pull Requests to add more features overtime to our vMenu, meaning we can add more features that can be similar to other vMenu clients.

## MenuAPI
Starting from vMenu v2.1.0, vMenu will be using [MenuAPI (MAPI)](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/MenuAPI), a custom menu API designed specifically for vMenu by me.

vMenu v2.0.0 and earlier was [using a modified version of NativeUI](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/NativeUI), originally by [Guad](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI), but converted to FiveM by the CitizenFX Collectives and myself (updated/refactored).
